# buzzr

buzzr is an R package for reading, shaping, and plotting results from
[buzzdetect](https://github.com/OSU-Bee-Lab/buzzdetect).

buzzr is not yet hosted on CRAN, so it cannot be installed with the
usual `install.packages` call. Instead, install the package `devtools`
(which can be installed via `install.packages`), then run the command
`devtools::install_github(repo='OSU-Bee-Lab/buzzr')`.

See [the walkthrough
vignette](https://osu-bee-lab.github.io/buzzr/articles/buzzr.html) for a
detailed introduction!
